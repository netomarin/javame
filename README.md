Java ME old toy projects
========================

Returning to the past, more precisely in 2007, I decided to start creating some Java ME apps to be used by me and my friends, and maybe, to try to distribute them and also, as portifolio apps, because that time I've already believed that mobile apps were the future of personal computing.

Both apps were developed to run on devices CLDC 1.1 and MIDP2, at that time these were the main Java ME profile and configuration available.

Full source code is under src/ folders and if you wanna try the apss in your Java ME phone, you should look at deployed folder and install the jar and jad files. Enjoy! =)

ChurrasCalculator
-----------------

App to calculate what you need to buy to do a great barbecue!

You just need to put how many men, women and the expected duration. Based on some well known premises that I acumulated during my life, some calculations are done and the to buy list is shown.

It's possible to save a barbecue and retrieve whenever you want.

If you want to study Java ME, with this code you can understand better the MIDlet life-cycle, to use commands, some basic UI controllers and persistence.

ContaDiButeco
-------------

App to help you and your friends to split the bill on a bar or a restaurant.

You just need to inform people at your table and what was consumed. And for each item consumed, it's possible to inform which people consumed that item, and so the division is made between people correctly for each item.

Thus, the account will be divided fairly. =)
